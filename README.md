<h1>Customer_Segmentation_Analysis</h1>

This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment a customer dataset into different groups based on their spending habits. The dataset includes information on customer income, spending score, and product purchases. The K-Means algorithm was used to identify clusters of customers, each with distinct spending patterns. The results of the clustering analysis can be used to better understand customer behaviour and to develop targeted marketing campaigns.

The project was implemented in Python using the Jupyter Notebook environment. The code is well-documented and easy to follow. The project also includes a detailed analysis of the results
